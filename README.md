# ptzctrl
Wrapper for remote control of hi3510 based IP cameras. Please look at the demo.cpp to see usage and how you can control your camera with a game controller. I used an xbox 360 controller. The demo uses [drewnoakes/joystick](https://github.com/drewnoakes/joystick) API for capturing the input of the controller.

## Requirements
